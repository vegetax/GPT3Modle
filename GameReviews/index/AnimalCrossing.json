            "text": "and we're back with another episode of before you buy that sure we give you some straight-up gameplay and our first impressions of the latest games releasing as usual it's me your guide Jake and today we're talking about Animal Crossing new horizons it's a very special time right now honestly like for some there's there's a lot of time to play video games and we've seen do maternal and Animal Crossing released the same day so basically lots of different gamers with different tastes have their bases covered here and thankfully Animal Crossing New Horizons is really great it's very much a game that is like and if you know you know type of thing if you get it you get it I've always kind of struggled to explain to people why it's so enjoyable it's just charming it's addictive its relaxing which might be what some of us really need right now especially if you're dealing directly with the coronavirus stuff New Horizons is a bigger bit more social more creative game and what I enjoy the most is that to me it does feel like Nintendo looked at Animal Crossing and said you know if it ain't broke don't fix it so that's actually pretty great the new stuff here though does fit right in now keep in mind a lot of our gameplay footage here is early on and this is first impressions you're gonna see a lot more as time progresses in the game I'm playing pure I'm not like time-traveling or anything like that with in-game time I don't have a V a review copy I'm sure you've already seen some cool stuff online elsewhere but I'm just gonna let a lot of it runs so newcomers can just see what the typical average gameplay loop is like cuz honestly it's pretty chill now after asking on social media how I should approach this video because I wasn't sure I listened to you guys and I'm gonna do this in two chunks the main part first I'll give the pitch to newcomers people who have never really played an animal crossing game why this one is good why I think it's like for a very specific type of player who wants a very specific type of experience then after that I'll acknowledge and get into some of the new stuff at it that I really enjoy for you know regular fans of the series so what is the deal with Animal Crossing it's all about the chill vibes you know it's getting into a flow of the gameplay loop that's the main event it's partly a grind but not really but also it's part rewarding you rate your character with a few simple customization options that do expand later on and you're dumped onto an abandoned island getaway with two other tourist neighbors and the raccoon company that brought you there basically it's like you're establishing a colony you know you set up a tent anywhere you want on this small island and begin doing these non stressful activities to slowly progress you know you're catching fish you're chasing bugs with a net you're collecting seashells you're digging stuff in holes you're harvesting fruit off of trees chopping trees to get wood to them craft stuff selling stuff you find at the local store to get money use that money to either buy cool stuff for your little tent or pay off your in-game loans so that tent eventually becomes a house that eventually can become a bigger house you know yada yada yada you can customize the floor the wallpaper you can fill it with items to express yourself slowly grow the desolate camping island you inhabit into a real town with like a museum stocked with fossils and animals a real proper shop and way more inhabitants there's cool music and sound effects and lots of cutesy goofy dialogue that all the inhabitants kind of spout constantly everybody wants to talk to you everybody's your friend for the most part in the earlier moments blathers has some really good dialogue that I really liked in fact some of the characters are just beloved and well-known throughout the series now for a good reason a few hours with this game if you're a newcomer you'll probably be hooked and you're gonna want a shirt with cake a slider on it or something like that trust me you spend your time drawing pictures to put in your house or wear on your shirt you travel and visit other friends",
