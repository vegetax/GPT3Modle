building houses is way better but at the same time a major lack of expected features and a small broken up world don't let them live their lives to the fullest even though it's fun it's a big letdown that the sequel doesn't inspire the same wow factor as the sims 3 did when I first played it years ago let me to show B yes when I first created a sim I was impressed by the great push and pull body customization tools and selection of expressive walks but disappointed that I could only assign for total traits that turned out to be less of a problem that I'd imagined because the new emotion system makes a lot out of a little it's really cool and easily the best thing about the sims for emotions open up new contextual opportunities like being able to brighten someones day when happy it

inspired husband tell his wife about his dreams it's a slow burn though it took me about 15 hours of playing to fully appreciate the complexity of sim emotions but now I'm really enjoying it the big shock to the system happens when you leave your Sims house for the first time loading screens are everywhere even when you just want to go next door they're not nearly as long as the one Sims 3 fans are used to but I'm really disappointed with the Sims 4 a segmented world it feels more like going back to the sims 2 than it does the openness of the sims 3 Zambo Skiba zu the to love zoobi

the world is so small it felt like I kept running into the same few people no matter where I went which limited social opportunities you can't even make new friends at work and job opportunities are limited too I ended up keeping my sim at her house most of the time but thanks to the new and improved multitasking feature being at home wasn't so bad even as my sim worked as a programmer a friend could come over and chat to keep her company at the same time conversations have a similarly easy flow and they can involve more than just two sims it's really nice to not to micromanage Sims interactions at every turn and it's especially fun to watch for these more intelligent conversations go when you're not interfering on more than one occasion I've watched Sims gain the embarrassed

tools that make building houses more flexible and less frustrating than ever like the ability to pick up entire rooms and move them anywhere on the lot without raising them to the ground and rebuilding from scratch and the push and pull tool allows you to move or resize an entire length of wall at once some tools are quirky though foundations are now applied retroactively Lee which is cool but unfortunately it applies to every structure on the entire lot it means no split levels and no garages but since there aren't any cars in The Sims 4 the ladder isn't a huge deal except no cars

space-age look with the tools available it just makes me sad that I can't make cool pajamas in the exact print I want or buy a couch in the style and color I'd like doomageddon here transitioning from the sims 3 to the sims 4 is a little rough the sims 4 is barren of content and expecting features by comparison some of these things are hard to get over especially the limited scope of the worlds and
