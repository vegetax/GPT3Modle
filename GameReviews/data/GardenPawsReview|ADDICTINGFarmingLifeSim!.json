but as you purchase new upgrades and shops you'll often be rewarded with a small increase to your stamina allowing you to work for longer the sandbox nature of the game also lets you place Furniture wherever you want in the world along with the ability to build houses as well I never really did this as it's my understanding that the houses you build are purely for aesthetic reasons as no one can actually move in or use these houses exploration is another great way to find items to sell in your shop and you've got quite a large island to cover you can find many items in your travels from fruits and vegetables to treasure chests filled with clothes or flowers animal goods and many other things to sell not only that but you'll stumble across a huge variety of animals all of which can be

disappointing as it was very empty and Bland I was happy to discover that as you progress and complete quests you'll end up filling the town to the broom with shops and new NPCs which is very rewarding in saying that though while NPCs have a hint of a personality they have no backstories minimal movement and there's no relationship building so keep that in mind if that's something that's important to you upgrading your town takes a lot of time and effort as purchasing new buildings can get quite expensive and you're often forking out these costs all by yourself you're almost

a ridiculous amount of quests to do in these type of games and that's exactly what Garden Paws delivered it kept me occupied I always had something to do and made for a very addicting game lastly there is a combat aspect which is done in a dungeon first person shooter type format here your goal is to go from level to level defeating the enemies and destroying these crystals and every 10 or so levels you'll find a boss it's a good way to break up the days at times when you find other stuff getting repetitive and you'll get some pretty good items to sell on your shop too overall while I could see where some improvements could be made I really enjoyed my playthrough and ended up getting about 60 hours out of this game which is insane honestly I could have", "title": "Garden Paws

you who want to invest a crazy amount of time into a single game keeping in mind that this game is a passion project developed by a wife and husband team garden pools looks a little outdated I found some Seasons look much better than others with Autumn looking really tacky and unnatural but winter looking really beautiful and nice I also found some other parts to be a bit basic such as no growth transitions with crops no facial expression changes for NPCs and all buildings are pretty much identical soundtrack is also again pretty basic but I barely even noticed that it kind of just Blends in

once they die on a few occasions where I started a new day I spawned somewhere else entirely and not in my house as I should have although this didn't really affect anything except making me a little bit paranoid at what other glitches could happen to ruin my 60 odd hours of gameplay some items would also glitch appearing as solid white objects again not a huge issue gameplay wise but it definitely wasn't pretty Garden pores is still playable even if it turns you into a paranoid break like it did for me as for the most part these issues did not affect gameplay too much I do recommend
