on when you're watching but i thought it was\u00a0 definitely worth it i'm super glad that i ended\u00a0\u00a0 up getting it and on sale like how cool is that\u00a0 so one thing about cozy grove that

i think is his name right i don't know\u00a0\u00a0 yes i just looked it up his name is flamie but you\u00a0 get to go and meet flamie and he kind of gives you\u00a0\u00a0 a little bit of an introduction on the island and\u00a0 what it's about why you're there kind of i tried\u00a0\u00a0 my best to pay attention it's kind of hard to like\u00a0 retain that information while i'm streaming but\u00a0\u00a0 you kind of get the gist you know the island's\u00a0 all haunted everybody's a ghost everyone also\u00a0\u00a0 happens to be a bear and you gotta go and like\u00a0 do your scout thing because you're a scout\u00a0\u00a0 and you're scouting speaking of bears everyone is\u00a0 indeed a bear it's very cute but not just a bear\u00a0\u00a0 a ghost bear and not just a ghost bear a ghost",

quests for these bears and it helps unlock\u00a0 further things throughout the game the game does\u00a0\u00a0 occur in real time so you're able to get on each\u00a0 day and complete all sorts of
