sandbox mode is where two point campus really shines letting you loose to build a school of your dreams on any of the 12 different themed plots some are outright wacky like a spy school that uses a burger joint as a cover others are a bit more vanilla and the same goes for the courses available with everything from general knowledge to actual night school with a k so you can kind of adjust your level of silliness to your preference which is nice each campus is introduced through a story driven scenario that includes its own special rules i definitely liked some of these more than others

once outside the bounds of scenario objectives i enjoyed how progression works adding more facilities and staff as well as leveling up your various rooms by adding decorations and more learning
