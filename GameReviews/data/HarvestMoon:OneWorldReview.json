appreciated after 25 years of very similar games in the right hands turning a farming simulator series into a plot driven exploration-focused adventure game sounds like a brilliant idea and yet one world fails in just about every way to do anything interesting or innovative with this new idea other than layer it on top of a deeply mediocre farming sim [Music] unlike its numerous harvest moon predecessors and competitors one world does not have you inherit an old farm in a dying village and spend years rebuilding them instead you're handed a newly invented portable farm in the first 10 minutes and sent off on an adventure across its world through five different towns with their own climates hazards and problems the problem is that the one world of one world is boring in every way

the aesthetics of one world are not where the mundanity ends unlike other harvest moon games where you get to know a town of distinct and personable neighbors there are few actual developed characters

behind a lot of time spent in the extremely boring minds [Music] with an empty world and a soulless cast that leaves the actual farming to carry one world and it doesn't because even though it has several new ideas that might have worked if they were handled differently here they're just clumsy [Applause] as is usual for the harvest moon games the harvest goddess is absent which has caused

harvest wisps scattered throughout the world will hand you one seed per day per wisp meaning much of your ability to actually use your farm is also tied to exploring the world plus each crop has certain seasons and regions of the world it grows better in you can still plant crops off season or in other areas but they'll grow more slowly or mutate and become different crops entirely there's a lot of potential here for fun experimentation with where you put your farm and what you grow and when but it's never realized the problem is that nothing is ever really explained sure there's a log that gives hints about how to get which mutations after you've already obtained them but even if you plant the same crop in the same region at the same time it doesn't always seem to mutate
