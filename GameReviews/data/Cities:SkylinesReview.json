inspiration couldn't creating huge detailed cities that take on a convincing life of their own with powerful building tools and extensive mod support feeding into an all-around impressive simulation this is the best city builder to come along in a decade building has to be its own reward though because the lack of random events or disasters leaves the job of running these towns feeling sleepy and meditative building a city from scratch is mostly conventional lay down roads with the easy-to-use tools designate zones provide utility services reap the tax boon then repeat the cycle with new stuff that's been unlocked by hitting population milestones skylines gets all these fundamentals pretty much right though it does err on the side of unnecessary complexity through busy work like laying

of that movement creates a complex traffic puzzle to solve and skylines tools make it easy to experiment as you look for a solution mass transit is a trickier beast it's easy to get lost in planning multiple routes especially as they start overlapping but there are lots of options and the endorphin rush for making a red traffic data overlay turn green makes it all what skyline's isn't so great about is telling you what you've done wrong and what problem you need to solve now for example when I hit fifty thousand citizens my city stopped indicating what new zones were in demand it didn't seem to want anything at all hundreds of buildings were abandoned without explanation how can i address the issues that are hamstringing my city when I don't even know what they are eventually the

disappointingly easy to keep in check I never had any trouble keeping my approval rating sky-high threats to your city are limited to the man-made kind because there are no earthquakes tornadoes destructive floods nuclear meltdown zombie outbreaks UFO or monster attacks or anything fun like that even fires won't spread from one building to another I don't mean to fault skylines for not

skylines is about the simple joy of building it's a really impressive and often beautiful simulation where an amazing number of virtual people go about their business across a huge swath of land getting in and creating something is easy though mastering it will require extensive research on community wiki's to understand why growth is stunted even when you've addressed your citizens apparent
