represent fanciful moves your ooblets can perform with silly names like tiki tap tap or one step pep each ooblet has its own set of signature move cards which makes collecting all of the different species extra fun as i never knew when a new game changing card would be held by a little ubered i just found that also means constructing a party is like a roundabout way of building a deck but there's less choice than in similar games since you can't alter the generic cards that make up the bulk of it i often found fantastic synergy between these signature cards of two ooblets but some other moves simply contributed to deck bloat that made any cool combos inconsistent purchasable cards are also permanently unlocked and can never be removed from your deck once", "title": "Ooblets

snuff for someone who's put hundreds of hours into dedicated games of the genre thankfully there's a lot more to ublets than just dance battling so the shallow deck building doesn't detract from the
