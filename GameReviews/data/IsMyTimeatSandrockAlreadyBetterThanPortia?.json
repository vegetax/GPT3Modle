    "text": "hey guys josh here and on may 26 2022 my time at cenrock the sequel to my time at porsche finally released in early access on steam this is a game i've been looking forward to for quite some time now it had been delayed numerous times as the developer patiai games had to wait for certification from their government before releasing the game but now everything is in order it is finally available for everyone to play so i would like to tell you what i think of this game so far and also how it compares to its predecessor patea games kindly sent me a review key for the game about 3 weeks ago so i've played a fair bit already keep in mind the game is still in early access so this is not a full review as some features are still incomplete and there may be a bit more bugs than there will be in the full release but hopefully this should give you a pretty good idea of how the game is like and if it's for you so let's start with the story characters and overall setting of the game first thing",

character it is pretty similar to how it was in porsha where you'll get to pick between male and female your character's voice hairstyle adjust some facial features to your liking but now we have a bit more options and flexibility than in the past for example when picking your hairstyle you get to choose the base style but now you can also add some bangs and ponytails if you'd like and adjust the length for each one of these parts individually for more customization that's just one example but if you're familiar with character creation in my timer porsche you can expect something very similar here with senrak but everything has been improved a little bit making the experience more enjoyable and you'll notice this pattern to be true for most of the game it's like porsche but improved once your character is created you'll take your train to cenrock", "title": "Is My Time at Sandrock Already Better Than Portia?", "author": "Josh's Gaming Garden", "publish_date":

who's planning to leave the town at first senrock doesn't look like the most welcoming place it's in the desert water is very scarce there isn't much to do for tourists and villagers but on the other hand as a builder there's so much work to do that it's hard to keep track of everything you'll get commissions to build things for the town do part-time jobs or errands to help local businesses and you'll protect senrock from threats that are becoming more and more frequent all of this while breathing the same storms i usually don't pay too much attention to the story in these type of games but

i did had an actual impact for example one quest will require you to plant flowers to decorate around sand rock well when you do that flowers will actually stay there from that point on so whenever you pass by these flowers you will remember the time that you planted them and it's just nice to see that it actually makes a difference in how the town looks for another quest justice one of the characters will ask you to craft a hat and he will then give that hat to his cat captain and from that point on when you go around town you'll see captain wearing the hat little details like these are everywhere in this game and it really makes you feel like you're evolving with the town gradually and you're really having an impact on the stories and lives of the characters and when you talk with

want to speak with everyone frequently just to see what they had to say and it's just nice to see that they actually acknowledge what's happening around them it makes them feel very alive and i would say that relationships as a whole are just so interesting in this game not only because the dialogues are diverse but also just for the little details like for example in order to know someone's birthday you'll have to wait for them to actually tell you once you start befriending them so you won't magically have everybody's birthday marked on your calendar the very first that you move to

gifts are the two main ways to increase your relationships however in my time at sunrock there's so much more you can do for example you can also fight with your friends in a duel just for fun or you can play critter cards which is a mini game pretty similar to rock paper scissors you can also go on a date you can complete commissions for them there's so much you can do and as you deepen your

aspect of the game and i try to interact with the villagers daily keep in mind that currently romance has not been fully implemented yet but we can expect marriage and children with the full release of the game which should be sometime next year now i'd like to talk a bit about the world so the first difference you'll notice going from porsche to sandrock is that it's not as green there's no

difference for example around your workshop you'll have a beautiful view of the town in other places you may have a view on some ruins or some mountains but there's always something grand and beautiful to look at and they did a great job at making the desert not look boring and repetitive we also still have four seasons so spring is summer autumn and winter and each one looks a little bit different for example in autumn you'll see the leaves turning orange and there's gonna be a little bit of snow in the winter so you still have some variety with the seasons and i have to say that

computer or just a game that needs a bit more optimization but just keep that in mind if you have a pc that's not very powerful however as i was saying it is a step up graphically i especially really enjoyed the lighting and how it changed throughout the day as well as how the characters look and the little details like their hair moving around and the different animations i would say it's one of the best looking games in the crafting or farming sim genre out there right now so now let's talk a little bit about the gameplay this game is of course mostly about crafting and crafting in games is

different crafting stations like a work table a grinder a processor a furnace and it takes a while to remember exactly which does what and you'll often have to process an item through multiple stations for example the rs into the furnace to make some bars and then the bars into the processor or maybe it was the grinder i can't remember to make nails but there's rarely more steps than that

chests and inventory so you'll be collecting tons of different items all the time but things like the ability to expand your backpack at any time anywhere by using coins sorting and transfer features to keep your chest well organized also all the chests being connected to each other meaning you can see the content of all of your chests simply by opening one of them also the ability to replace a small chest with a bigger one without having to transfer the items manually and most important of all crafting with items that are in your chest so that you don't have to take anything out you don't

could use wood or power stones which you would find a bit later in game one problem i had with parasites that i would always use all of my wood to fuel my crafting stations i would run out all the

as well and it just feels great another big quality of life improvement is with the assembly station so the assembly station allows you to craft bigger items that you wouldn't be able to make with the smaller stations and usually that's where you'll make the things to rebuild the town so it's pretty important in porsche you needed to select each required material in your toolbar and then you had to

anything as long as the materials were in your chest but somehow the game was super picky with the assembly station and you really needed to select it in your toolbar but in cenrock it's a lot easier you still need to have the items in your inventory but there's no need to select each one individually you just go to the assembly station press a button to place the item you no longer need to be at a very precise spot and this might seem like a small change but if you've played porsche you'll most likely really appreciate it it makes a big difference another nice addition is their recycler so

to do this every morning i don't know if there will be some sprinklers or any other way to water more than one crop at a time later in game but that's definitely something i would love to see there's

part of this game i would like to address is the combat once again this was improved quite a bit from porsche which a lot of people thought to be lackluster this time you can pick from four melee weapon types so there's a one-handed two-handed daggers and spear there's also a pistol for long-range combat and the first big improvement is obviously this diversity and how there's different weapon

combat feel much better than in the past also not exactly combat related but one more thing i would like to mention is that while in porsche you can only sprint for a little while before your character got exhausted in send rock you can sprint continuously and there's even an option letting you choose if you want to sprint by holding the button or just toggling it once and this makes

in early access on steam the full release won't be until 2023 and the switch version will have to wait a bit after that if you can i think it is worth playing right now you don't need to have played porsche to enjoy it as i just said but if you would like to play porsche it is on most consoles right now even ios and android but i think the pc version is the best in terms of graphics and performance so i think that's the way to go if you can and it goes on sale pretty often on steam so feel free to check it out on the other hand if you start with cenrock i think", "title": "Is My Time
