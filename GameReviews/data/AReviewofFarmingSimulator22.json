the channel you guys wanted me to review it so here we are now in all honesty a lot of my friends scoff at the thought of me playing farming sim and i can understand why because i probably would have too before i started playing the series back in 2013 but honestly it's one of the best sandbox experiences that money can buy and fs22 at least in my opinion is no exception but the main question is if you've played one of the other games before you're probably wondering if it's worth buying or if you should just stick to fs19 or even if you're new to the series you might be wondering if it's worth paying the extra cash to get the latest version of the game or if it's just almost the same as one of the previous and much cheaper games such as fs19 and that's what i'm going to be trying to cover in this video now fs22 and fs19 are really similar games", "title": "A Review of Farming Simulator 22", "author": "RedcoatViking", "publish_date": "2022-06-08", "chunk_size": 1000,

"that's what i'm going to be trying to cover in this video now fs22 and fs19 are really similar games graphically almost identical with some improved field textures to fs22 but what i'd say fs22 does so much more is it adds loads of really small but really noticeable quality of life improvements that make the game feel so much more complete and realistic and authentic and that's something i think the game's been lacking for quite a while and fs22 kind of manages to bring up the realism aspect and it although it doesn't bring a whole lot more new content it does still manage to cram some decent stuff in there as well so for me one of the biggest and most noticeable changes in fs22 is the audio especially when driving inside the cabin of a vehicle and you can hear the creaking and the bouncing of the wheels as you drive along the road and you hear it change as you go over uneven surfaces and it really feels like you're in the vehicle and i really appreciate that there are still

person in the cab and then they've also added tree felling sound effects which kind of sounds a bit ridiculous now that i say it you should always really have heard a tree falling over but because of the sandbox nature of the game and the physics nature of it all i imagine that actually took quite some work so being able to hear the tree falling over after you've cut it down really just adds an extra layer of of quality at least to me now like i said graphically the game is very very similar if not identical to fs19 and it does look a little bit shinier but it's not going to blow you away and the game does look good though but fs19 look good too but they have added some much better field textures for when you uh use the new rollers over grass for example", "title": "A Review of Farming

you see the grass mush down you also get a fertilizer bonus for that which is fairly realistic and the biggest improvement to me is the ploughing texture the ploughing now when you plow a field it looks like you've actually created grooves in the land now there is still no terrain deformation so you're not actually making holes in the ground but as far as i know no farming sim has ever managed to pull that off so it must be incredibly hard to do but the textures they've added look really really good so it's kind of easy to forget that you're not actually deforming the terrain it just it looks good enough to believe that you are well overall i think i think the graphics have had a slight bit of polish and a very small improvement over fs19 but like i said the overall graphics quality of the game is pretty much the same on the vehicle maintenance side of things they have done a few changes", "title": "A Review of Farming Simulator 22", "author": "RedcoatViking", "publish_date":

all um your vehicles can get a little bit rusty and as they age the performance also goes down they've also added manual gearboxes which you can toggle on and off but all vehicles now have manual gears even if you choose automatic so they'll still go up through one two three four and high and low and all that even if it's on automatic and that's both good and bad um that's always been a mod for previous farming sim games i've never really wanted it i don't see the point i get a bit tired of shifting gears even if it's just two keys on the keyboard or with a h shifter it's not really my thing it's cool for people that do want it but what to me the biggest impact that has is even if you choose automatic gears if you're in an underpowered tractor going up a hill pulling a plow that

was in previous farming some games however if you're not an idiot like me and you actually get a tractor that is strong enough to pull the machinery over hill well you probably won't notice any of the problems and all of everything i've said here will be in vain something you might like though is that they've added seasons the old seasons mod from previous games so now you can toggle that on and

previous games the same way that hay and all other grass and everything you can pile up can be shoveled using a wheel loader and bucket and dumped wherever you like it and it'll melt automatically when it starts getting warm again maps included in the game are pretty nice definitely much more detail in the vanilla maps for the first time in many many years there's one us map one european map and then there's ellen grant which was a dlc i think it's somewhere in the swiss or austrian mountains uh in fs19 which was one of my favorite maps so i'm glad it's there now too so you get three maps

the previous mods in the previous games and i don't want to keep on just referencing previous games but we're so far into this series now i'm kind of thinking you might have already played it if you're watching this but it hopefully still makes sense if you don't know anything about farming sim either way now you can tell an ai where you want them to go and you can set that destination anywhere on the map it's really easy to do you pay them wages just as if they're working in the field and it seems to work really well and it saves you having to go back and forward to the shop if you

and you get the same 400 plus vehicles with over 100 brands including fent class john deere and landini the vehicles are actually really well done but i've never really had a problem with the vanilla vehicles in farming sims so that is to be expected at this point one thing they seem to have spent a lot of time on a little bit surprisingly is the character customizer and i'd say it's worthy almost of an mmo um you have a lot of clothes to choose from and you can customize your character both before you join the game every single time and from like a little wardrobe once you're in the game so

more virtual hands-on experience where you get to see the object or the vehicle you're going to buy you get to rotate the camera and have a look at it and it'll also tell you the best combinations or the recommended combinations for hooking that piece of machinery up to something else and you can buy that next piece of equipment from the combinations panel which is really nice because sometimes

that up to which is really nice the driving feel and the general handling of the driving has also been given some much-needed polish but we are still talking about farming sim here so it is still a little bit twitchy at high speeds and it's still entirely possible to launch a quad bike from one side of the map to the other and then probably get it stuck in the invisible wall surrounding a fence on the other side so like i said there are improvements but this is still farming simulator it's still the same kind of stiff engine and certain things especially when driving high speed and a tractor

i suppose a good thing if you if you want to drive backwards and forwards over the fields even more but really whenever you plow a field it digs up so many stones and you have to have a really pricey piece of machinery to remove the stones and in reality although you know it's trying to add and simulate more realism by making you remove stones it is ultimately just making you drive backwards and forwards on the same field just more times um when you already if you consider you already have to fertilize do weed removal you have to cultivate you have to plow you have to spray lime um there's a whole bunch of stuff you need to do so just adding something else to make you drive backwards and forwards on that field even more to me is a little bit unappreciated but the good thing is you can

of them but there was an old blue tractor with no roof there was um you started with an mfr m66 combine harvester which looks really ugly but to me that is farming sim you kind of start at the bottom and work your way up now you tend to get more modern equipment you start ellen grant for example um with a electrified tractor and a bunch of other stuff pretty pricey and modern machinery and i would

one of the previous games before it is definitely worth making the jump from previous games the only exception to that is if you really like fs19 and you're not too bothered about having things like having to remove stone from the fields having seasons because that is to be fair a mod that you can download for free in fs19 anyway you're not bothered about the character customization and overall it is still worth it because the grapes and the olives are there the textures are better there's a destination center for the ai but is it worth the extra money for me it was personally because i like

experience there's no reason unless price is your biggest concern there's no reason to get fs19 over fs22 if you're coming into the series now or if you haven't upgraded your game since like fs17 or fs15 so unless money is a big factor because fs19 is a lot cheaper then definitely go for fs22 if you need to save a bit of cash then fs19 if you're brand new would be the best place to start and
