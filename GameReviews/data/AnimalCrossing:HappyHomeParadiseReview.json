tropical paradise flexing my creativity to help people build the vacation homes of their dreams [Music] happy home paradise lets you visit a resort archipelago to work at paradise planning a company that helps villagers build their very own vacation homes if that sounds like a familiar concept you probably played happy home designer on the 3ds back in 2015. your job is to recruit potential

reign and creative control to build within the instructions you even have your pick at a handful of islands to build on each with different features and sometimes different seasons giving you full control over how the home will look both inside and out that freedom could be a little overwhelming at first but over time it encouraged me to think outside of the box when decorating especially when

using these spaces brings a lot more interactivity and makes them feel more active than your own home island too [Music] after a bit of playing you unlock the ability to have two villagers share a vacation home as roommates pairing them up can be very useful if you have clients that want similar themes or heck if you just want to have a couple you've been pretending or dating finally move in
