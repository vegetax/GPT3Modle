charm and humor that almost always prevents its sometimes repetitive challenge-free gameplay from becoming a slog over the course of its 9 or 10 hours it's been difficult to tell by looking at its trailers but this is a story driven first person adventure game with light puzzling and a surprising amount of emotional depth and character development and manages to tell a solid story complete with twists and turns along the way and while not being much of a technical showcase for the playstation 5's launch snaptooth island is definitely a place worth visiting for the wildlife on show alone just

through your camera and pressing down on r2 to snag a snap of a snack the parallels between this and pokemon snap are easily drawn but from there on bug snacks becomes its own beast once scanned a bug

writing and constant joy of finding something you just haven't seen before it could so easily have been a stodgy repetitive drudge of repetitive actions without any desire to see where it all leads fortunately bug snap stays true to its principles throughout and just when you think you've worked out its story throws another left turn your way and lands an ending after a fantastic action-packed
