*0.842; [Name]: Is My Time at Sandrock Already Better Than Portia?; [Descriptions]: having an impact on the stories and lives of the characters and when you talk with these people they'll very often have unique dialogues referring to the events happening in town and the latest things you've accomplished this made me want to speak with everyone frequently just to see what they had to say and it's just nice to see that they actually acknowledge what's happening around them it makes them feel very alive and i would say that relationships as a whole are just so interesting in this game not only because the dialogues are diverse but also just for the little details like for example in order to know someone's birthday you'll have to wait for them to actually tell you once you start befriending them so you won't magically have everybody's birthday marked on your calendar the very first that you move to sandrock it's actually something you'll have to discover gradually and for me it really helps getting immersed into the game it's the same for the gifts so sometimes villagers

*0.841; [Name]: Is My Time at Sandrock Already Better Than Portia?; [Descriptions]: me it really helps getting immersed into the game it's the same for the gifts so sometimes villagers will give you hints about items that they like and you have to give them things before they are added to their list of likes and dislikes i'm pretty sure this was the same in porsha but it's a feature i really like it makes it fun to try to find out what people like and dislike so in most games chatting with people and giving gifts are the two main ways to increase your relationships however in my time at sunrock there's so much more you can do for example you can also fight with your friends in a duel just for fun or you can play critter cards which is a mini game pretty similar to rock paper scissors you can also go on a date you can complete commissions for them there's so much you can do and as you deepen your relationships you will unlock perks such as increased stats or maybe discounts in the different shops and for me to be honest usually i always struggle to get interested in

*0.837; [Name]: Is My Time at Sandrock Already Better Than Portia?; [Descriptions]: cutscenes as well as the brilliant and diverse cast doing the voiceover it's very easy to follow along and stay entertained however i think that the biggest thing for me is i felt everything i did had an actual impact for example one quest will require you to plant flowers to decorate around sand rock well when you do that flowers will actually stay there from that point on so whenever you pass by these flowers you will remember the time that you planted them and it's just nice to see that it actually makes a difference in how the town looks for another quest justice one of the characters will ask you to craft a hat and he will then give that hat to his cat captain and from that point on when you go around town you'll see captain wearing the hat little details like these are everywhere in this game and it really makes you feel like you're evolving with the town gradually and you're really having an impact on the stories and lives of the characters and when you talk with these people

*0.832; [Name]: Doraemon Story of Seasons Friends of the Great Kingdom REVIEW.. IS IT GOOD?; [Descriptions]: house and stuff so I don't know there's a lot of farming games where I see the NPCs and they're just kind of there and they serve a purpose but in this game I felt a connection with these characters and uh that was pretty surprising to me in terms of the mechanics you will see some familiar tools and activities such as growing crops and growing crops in this game is pretty standard for all the story Seasons farming games you plant your seeds you can add fertilizer you can water them and of course that's only the basics uh you can get different crops for each season it's pretty standard in that regard you can do things like fish catch bugs go to the mine lines and get oars and things like that if you play these types of games you know exactly the activities to expect but this game does everything quite well of course when you start these kind of games your bag is limited your farm doesn't look great you don't have any farm animals you don't have much money or anything but that's sort of

*0.826; [Name]: Why Stardew Valley Is So Awesome; [Descriptions]: to fulfill their dreams of wifing up a weird-ass e-girl that eats rocks or befriending a grumpy old man in a wheelchair. It's much different. Each of the villagers in Pelican Town and the various characters that you meet while playing the game are super unique, each with their own personalities and quirks. There are different benefits to befriending different people, and everyone does their own thing throughout the day. The game feels truly alive and it seems like all of these villagers would continue to live their lives even if you weren't there. I love walking around the town and seeing what everybody has going on in their lives and seeing what they wanna talk about. I like when I go to the mines and get to interact with Linus, who I'm trying way too freaking hard to befriend after I accidentally was a jerk to him early in my playthrough. You can gain hearts with
